					<p>
						Our climate model, which combines <strong>rainfall</strong>, {" "}
						<strong>temperature</strong>, and <strong>humidity</strong>,
						explains approximately <strong>33.7%</strong> of the variation in
						water levels. While this is a meaningful improvement, it also shows
						that <strong>66% of the changes</strong> remain unexplained by
						weather alone.
					</p>

					<p>
						This indicates that <strong>other, non-climatic factors</strong> {" "}
						likely play a major role in the fluctuations of the Sea of Galileeâ€™s
						water level:
					</p>

					<ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
						<li>
							<strong>ðŸš° Water Pumping & Usage:</strong> Significant quantities
							are extracted for agriculture, urban supply, and industry. This
							human activity reduces levels regardless of rainfall.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>ðŸš› National Water Carrier:</strong> Israelâ€™s main water
							distribution system draws directly from the lake, further
							influencing natural levels.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>ðŸ“Š Government Policy:</strong> Water storage, export
							regulations, and emergency drought decisions also impact the lake.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>ðŸŒŠ Subsurface Flows:</strong> Underground springs,
							seepage, and geological features may cause hidden inflows or
							outflows.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p className="pt-2">
						These factors must be considered alongside weather when building any
						long-term strategy to understand or manage the lakeâ€™s water
						behavior.
