# 💧 WaterScope – Climate Impact on the Sea of Galilee

WaterScope is a web-based system that analyzes how weather patterns—such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity—affect the water levels of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret).  
The system combines real data, forecasting models, and visualizations to support environmental analysis and decision-making.

## 🌍 Project Goals

- Collect real-world climate and hydrological data related to the Sea of Galilee.
- Analyze the impact of rainfall, temperature, and humidity on water levels using statistical and machine learning models.
- Present results interactively through a modern React-based interface using Recharts and Leaflet maps.
- Provide accurate water level forecasts using ARIMA time-series modeling.
- Support users (e.g., students, researchers, environmentalists) in understanding long-term trends and factors.
